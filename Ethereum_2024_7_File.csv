1e4ypo7,Explain me Business Model of L2 companies,0,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1e4ypo7,3,"Hi!

Layer 2 solutions are made for scalability purposes. By batching and compressing data, they improve the whole Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.

These networks are built by companies (Matter Labs, Offchain Labs, Consensys, OP Labs, etc.) that will eventually and progressively decentralize network operations.

But, as any company needs to make profits, I'm wondering what is their business model to make profits for themselves? 
Validators and Stakers make money for contributing to the network security. But what is the incentives for the company spending millions of $ to build the foundation of these networks?

For the moment, since most of these networks are centralized and operated by the companies' nodes but their part should progressively reduce as they will keep moving into decentralization.

Is their business model focused on next applications they will build on these networks?
Or is it only focused on operating validators?
Or is it just R&D? But I can't imagine investors would bring millions without having an idea of how they will make money out of it.

Thanks!",2024-07-16

1e4u80j,Meme Coin Creation: What I Learned,0,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1e4u80j,10,"A few months ago, I thought about how meme coins make huge gains, with the creators making the most money. So I decided to launch my own meme coin.

I chose to create it on the Base network because Solana was having issues at the time. I also considered TON, but there's less money there. Base uses EVM, which means the tools would work on Ethereum or other EVM networks too.

First, I wanted to make sure the token would score 100/100 on checkers. This meant creating a contract where the creator has no control after launch, and locking or burning the liquidity pool (LP) to prevent rug pulls.

I learned that a good meme coin needs a website, Twitter, and Telegram, along with the meme itself and lots of images. After launching the pool, you need to pay to add your logo and links on DexTools and DexScreener.

I decided on a stealth launch instead of a presale. It's common to put 100% of the tokens in the pool at creation, or maybe keep up to 7% for yourself.

How does the developer make money if all tokens are in the pool? They buy back some tokens right after creating the pool, when the price is lowest.

I planned to put all tokens and 0.4 ETH in the pool. If I bought tokens worth 0.4 ETH right after launch, I'd get 50% of all tokens. If I wanted 75%, I'd need to buy 1.2 ETH worth.

The total cost for launching a meme coin, including website creation, pool setup, buying back 50% of tokens, and paying for listings, came to about $5,300.

I learned it's better to spread the tokens across many wallets instead of keeping them in one, as large holdings scare potential buyers. Ideally, no wallet should hold more than 2% of all tokens.

To make everything look good on bubble maps (which show connections between token holders), you need to spread ETH across multiple wallets and buy from each one on Uniswap.

[Bubble Map](https://preview.redd.it/mu8w3algywcd1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4fb87181d7fb6042c2efd0aa6dd1473ff9d318c)

For a long-lasting token, you need to create pumps by buying tokens, then dump to take profits, and simulate activity between pumps. Doing this manually is impossible, so you need a market maker. I couldn't afford to hire one, so I decided to write my own market maker bot. I created a wallet generator and a script for initial buyback.

When I launched, sniper bots bought a bunch of tokens in the first minute. I had to cancel that pool and create a new one. On the second try, only two sniper bots bought small amounts. I ran my script to buy tokens from 100 wallets, then burned the LP and paid for listings.

Users came and bought some tokens in the first half-day, but most sold after that, and the token didn't grow further. I improved my bot to do wash trading and create pumps, but I realized that pumps in older tokens don't get noticed. To grow further, I'd need to figure out how to buy effective advertising, which I don't know how to do yet and can't afford.

Basically, it seems you can't just launch a token and make money without investing in advertising.   
I've paused my meme coin experiment for now. I'd be interested in continuing with a partner who has crypto traffic or experience in advertising meme coins.

I won't share the token, but I'm happy to answer other technical questions in the comments. If you're interested in the market maker script or partnership, message me on Telegram: akamitch

satBalwyn,"yes, since I am more familiar with Lido's stETH, will try to explain stETH.  
In normal conditions, stETH gets postive rebase which mean the balance is increasing.

If few slashing events take place and the (instant and subsequent) losses could be covered by the rewards, stakers' stETH still gets positive rebase.

If there is a massive slashing event, stETH may get negetive rebase, which means stETH balance could decrease.

However, no massive slashing takes place in Lido so far and Lido has an insurance fund to try to cover as much as possible.",3,3,0,1e4hseu,,2024-07-01
Giga79,"rETH works the same as the other poster described with Lido.

Only difference being on Rocket Pool validators are required to put up (minimum) 10% collateral before participating. In case of bad or malicious validation this collateral is taken away from first (and the validator removed from the Ethereum network) before the Rocket Pool network experiences any penalties. If some% of validators are slashed beyond this 10%, as an rETH holder you'd notice a temporary decrease in APR but wouldn't be slashed yourself. Only if a large% of validators are slashed at the same time would the ETH backing the rETH pool be affected, meaning how much ETH you can redeem your rETH for.

I outlined the most likely case for a large slashing event in my other post. The other case for mass slashing would be majority collusion, which I don't think is likely at all. Either case would be extremely bad for Ethereum and most (not all) stakers..

Client diversity is KEY (ie *not* using a majority client). Since RP is permissionless I can only assume not all validators are using the same one client... The minority of validators still online after a mass slashing event would receive a great boost in staking rewards, so the rETH APR would increase 2-3fold despite its value decreasing proportionately to how much ETH was slashed - too many variables to guess when/if those two would balance out, but with an APR under 10% it would probably take a very long time.",1,1,0,1e4hseu,,2024-07-01

* zkVMs took center stage, with Jolt, SP1, and Risc Zero each releasing updates that pushed the boundaries of verifiable computation.

* This quarter also witnessed the first mainnet launch of a ZK application platform, with Mina’s Berkeley upgrade. Their zkApps environment will make building ZK applications much more accessible to non-ZK-native developers, and we expect other programmable ZK platforms, such as Aleo and Aztec, to launch soon as well. 

* In terms of ZK applications, several new products addressing payments, on-ramps, voting, and ID were announced or released this past quarter.

* On the ZK Supply Chain front, we saw additional teams announce their plans include a prover marketplace in their systems, and a new category of project emerged in this stack — proof verification aggregators.

A month ago, I fell victim to a scam promoted through a YouTube sponsored video about a Uniswap slippage MEV bot. I lost 2000$ unfortunately, after realizing my funds were irretrievable, I started monitoring the scammer's wallet address: 0x46D4cEe5d1531A8045c3084D18B6b3c2f5429560

This address seems extremely busy, with thousands of dollars moving through it every minute. Upon doing some research, I discovered that other people who got scammed also reported that their funds end up at this address.

Just for a fun I've obtained PEPU for $50 on [https://pepeunchained.com/en/dashboard](https://pepeunchained.com/en/dashboard) which resulted in 2990 PEPU. I can see it on the website and they are stacked.

  
But today I've recieved 10000 PEPU on my wallet. Here is the token: https://etherscan.io/token/0xad162d5523cde449d91e3be69ca38bc157b18e53. I've recieved it from ""pepu deployer"" wallet.

  
I did not understand what is it? Airdrop? Stake reward?

I've tried to sell it on Uniswap, but the transaction was frozen on the last ""approving"" stage. What is it? Is it real PEPU tokens? Is it possible to sell them?

1e1pfmw,How Danksharding (Blobs) will help ZK-Rollups?,5,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1e1pfmw,3,"As far as I have learnt, Optimistic Rollups need to post the entire transaction data as CALLDATA or BLOBs to the mainnet to allow other validators to verify the correctness. ([Refer 1](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20optimistic,of%20state%20transitions))

But this is not the case for ZK-Rollups as posting the entire transaction data in mainnet is optional. ([Refer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20can%20compress%20transaction%20data%20better%20than%20optimistic%20rollups%20since%20they%20don%27t%20have%20to%20post%20all%20the%20data%20required%20to%20validate%20each%20transaction.%20They%20only%20have%20to%20post%20the%20minimal%20data%20required%20to%20rebuild%20the%20latest%20state%20of%20accounts%20and%20balances%20on%20the%20rollup))

1. Then, how BLOBs are gonna help ZK-Rollups? (Both are doing the same thing: Keep the main net light)
2. ZK-Rollups are costly compared to Optimistic Rollups with Blobs. If yes, why can't we research more on ZK-Rollups rather than on BLOBs. (ZK-Rollups have faster transaction finality and easy to verify)

AltExplainer,"ZK rollups still need to post enough data to Ethereum in order for people to recreate the state of the rollup so they also have call data.

Essentially a merkle root of the state of the rollup is stored on Ethereum. The whole merkle tree is stored by the rollup nodes. If the rollup nodes were to shut down, everyone's funds would be frozen. Enough data to recreate the whole merkle tree needs to be posted to Ethereum so either other people can start up rollup nodes or merkle proofs of assets can be created in case the rollup nodes shut down without sharing it.

1e1g3ja,Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s,0,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1e1g3ja,7,"I am planning to make a smart contract. Long story short, I made an AI trading bot and it has been doing pretty well for almost 3 years. The AI is especially good at trading ETH/USDT or ETH/USDC pairs. My plan is to make a smart contract, let people deposit funds in, let the AI trade with those funds, and I take part of the realized gain as commission.

There will be a token representing shares of the pooled funds, I plan to call it JCT. Its value always equals to the total funds in the pool divided by the total JCT supply. When the pool has 500k USDC, 300 ETH and the current supply of JCT is 10k, each JCT can redeem 50 USDC and 0.03 ETH trustlessly. When people deposit money in, the contract issues new JCT based on the current price. When people withdraw money, the contract burns the JCT.

My address will be the admin address. The admin address can only do the following things:

1. Swap ETH/USDC via Uniswap.
2. Set commission percentage (between 0 and 1).

So there is no chance I can steal the funds, commission can only be taken from realized gain (the formula will be hardcoded in the contract). The only risk is I (the AI bot) made many bad swaps and run the funds to zero, but that's not likely given it has been performing well for almost 3 years, and when it start to go south, users can always withdraw. The design is to be as trustless as possible.

But here is the problem, how do I implement this across multiple L2s?

Ideally, the value of JCT should equal to the total funds in all networks divided by the total supply of JCT in all networks. But is it even possible to make contract aware of the funds in other networks? If I run this contract independently in each L2, eventually they will drift apart from each other due to different fees and slightly different swap prices. What is the solution to this?",2024-07-12

Iron_Monkey,"If you read Vitalik's full comment linked in that article, he is referring to holding ETH on Ethereum (**which includes L2s like Base**) being safer in comparison to holding a wrapped version of SOL from Solana's chain on Ethereum (*and vice versa*).

>Now, imaging what happens if you move 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there's a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it's still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this.

>**For this reason, it's always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum**. **And in this context, ""Ethereum"" refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it.** If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so ""cross-rollup"" applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked. And if Ethereum does *not* get 51% attacked, there's no way to 51% attack Arbitrum and Optimism separately.

Giga79,"Any L2 ETH persists inside of the L1 by definition. It never goes off-chain or leaves the L1. 

You're just leasing the L2 to move your ETH within the L1 smart contract. It does this in batches of large numbers and via fancy compression techniques (while utilizing blobs, which have a separate fee market from blocks), reducing the network cost to move balances around vs you doing it individually.

If the L2 censors, goes offline, breaks, or otherwise fails to do its job you just revert back to L1 to move your funds out of the L1 contract instead, and that can be done without the L2's help/permission. This would be inconvenient if you're avoiding L1 fees, but not insecure. Even in malicious attempts the L2 cannot steal or misappropriate your ETH/crypto-assets since those remain secured by L1 validators.

You are right to assume not every L2 is inherently as secure as the L1. Not every L2 is a ""real L2"" with this sort of scheme in place yet, many are still in their early-beta days with admin keys that can change the contract functions (to avoid detrimental bugs during live testing, and to upgrade to a final/decentralized state more efficiently), however Base(which is really Optimism) is not one of those L2's. Stage 0 L2's have no fraud proofs and are centralized, Stage 1 has fraud proofs, and Stage 2 has fraud proofs and are maximally decentralized. You can compare risks/progress of all the different L2's at L2beat. Any L2 with ""fraud proofs"" allows you to force-exit from the contract even if the L2 has gone offline.",7,7,0,1dzyeut,,2024-07-01

poginmydog,"OP this is gonna be complicated so follow along.

What OP could maybe do is to buy/sell a contract to buy ETH at X price. This at least ensures that should OP win, he’d know that his winnings can pay off X amount of ETH. If he loses, he’d need to buy ETH at X price, from his own pocket. However, assuming ETH is X price now, OP could sell his ETH at X price now. 

Let’s give it an example in numerical terms for clarification. OP sells 5 ETH for let’s say 2K each for a total of 10K USDC today. OP then buys a contract to buy 5 ETH at 2K on election day for a total cost of 10K USDC. He now bets 10K USDC against Trump with a 2x payout, meaning he’ll win 10K USDC if Trump loses. 

On election day, Trump loses. OP wins 10K USDC, which is then used to settle his contract. This results in OP effectively winning 5 ETH, no matter the price of ETH on election day. This means that OP wins 5 ETH against his original 5 ETH. 

If Trump wins, OP loses his original 10K USDC, and has to buy 5ETH for 10K (or void the contract). This means that OP effectively loses 5ETH, no matter the price of ETH on that day. 

Of course we haven’t taken into account of premiums etc. 

In short, buying contracts ensures ETH is at the same price now and on election day, so that OP could bet in USDC now and still has a fixed ETH price on election day, effectively turning the bet into an ETH bet.",1,1,0,1dzn2l4,,2024-07-01

This way when Optimism upgrades to further decentralize or turn into a ZK-rollup Coinbase can inherit those features with very little work in their Base L2, leaving them to focus solely on scaling Base for the best UX without worrying about security/zero knowledge proofs etc. I'd love to see specialized app-layers emerge as these forks (eg: OPCraft) rather than tons and tons of 'ETH equivalent' chains that we don't really need.

If it's all open source it should be pretty straight forward to redeploy on L2 for relatively little cost. The fact no one has done it sort of makes me think it wasn't all open source, maybe the frontend was closed source and did a bit more than it lead on. I haven't looked into it whatsoever so just positing, but it is weird especially given Polymarket's great success lately (basically turning out to be this season's NFT or DeFi craze).",1,1,0,1dzn2l4,,2024-07-01

It lost its immutability during the DAO hack when it split. It's history can be changed or deleted.


It also lost its Decentralization when it switched to Proof of Stake. It will become more and more centralized as money keeps going to the large Stake holders who will gain more percentage as time passes. 


It also lost its Trusted Ledger and proof of history with Proof of Stake. If a blackout were to happen, which chain would be followed in a proof of stake system when it starts back up? Solana had this issue already.

AmericanScream,">First mover advantage for smart contract technology space; strong brand recognition as the hegemon, similarly to BTC in the cryptocurrency space but specifically in the smart contract space;

""Smart Contracts"" have been around prior to the advent of blockchain.  In the database world, they're called ""stored procedures"" and they have much more power and flexibility than Ethereum's version.

>Smart Contract tech vs. BTC's store of value tech is a more wide-ranging use case in an ever-digitising world

Technology is a ""tool"".  Not a ""use case.""  It remains to be seen if any SC technology actually excels in any particular use-case.   I maintain [the official list of blockchain claims](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) and in 15 years, nobody has been able to cite a single thing blockchain does better than non-blockchain tech.

>Network size/development history; proven trackrecord of success and improvements so far, and imaginably this will continue even despite competitors like SOL

What ""success"" are you referring to?  To date, there's not a single thing *any* blockchain app has done that's better than existing non-blockchain applications.

>Many Layer 2s and Stablecoins rely on the ETH network so their success feeds into ETH's (and vice versa) - with the example of Polygon, it provides ETH more scalability, lowers the fees and increases the speeds, at least until ETH itself is able to achieve these feats within the first layer

Again, begging the question with this presumption of ""success.""  The L2s in most cases with blockchain, do not expand functionality as much as they compensate for limitations in the base design.  Eth may be slightly more scalable than BTC, but again, it's still nowhere near remotely competitive with existing non-blockchain ledger systems that have been in use decades prior to the advent of blockchain.

>(At present) disinflationary due to burn rate; not so negative in the face of long term holding in this particular area

The inflation/deflation argument is a marketing gimmick, not a legitimate feature.  Anybody championing a money system as being deflationary doesn't understand basic economics and how money is supposed to work in society.

>Staking (at least if you have a lot of ether or you want to be a part of a staking pool)

Another marketing gimmick with no actual utility beyond pandering to degenerate gamblers who want to excercise highly leveraged gambling.  Staking creates no value or utility and is just an excuse to reduce the likelihood of there being bank runs on the limited available liquidity in the market, which if done to a certain extent, will cause the ponzi to collapse.

>NFTs (I mean some people think that's important, right?)

Again, another marketing gimmick, designed primarily to create an illusory ""use case"" and ""perception of value"" where in reality, there are none.

>Good history for going up in value already, and a better record in this area than BTC, making it potentially more bullish; Spot ETF on the way already too

Nope.  Identical to BTC in terms of having zero intrinsic value and no way to create value or utility in the real world in any competitive way.  Any and all ""number go up"" metrics are primarily a function of wash trading, market manipulation and market inflation caused by billions of unsecured, un-audited stablecoins being arbitrarily introduced into the market.",-1,-1,0,1dwp1wo,,2024-07-01

This one is outright false. Super easy to disprove, barely an inconvenience. For example, make these two predictions:

* If I buy $1000 worth of BTC right now, how much will it be worth one year from now?
* If I buy $1000 worth of DAI right now, how much will it be worth one year from now?

Over the past year BTC's price went from a low of $34,000 to a high of $98,500 and is currently back down to $78,800.

Over the past year DAI's price went from a high of $1.0012 to a low of $0.9979 and is currently at $1.0001.

AmericanScream,">  The sending and receiving of value on the blockchain far exceeds anything before it.

That 'value' is highly subjective and very limited in scope.  The vast majority of the world does not consider crypto tokens to be a store of value.  A very tiny minority of (pot committed) people do, and yet you can't do anything normal or useful with crypto at this point.  

>1.347 billion dollars worth of value was sent between two parties for a cost of 2.06.

Again ""dollars worth"" and ""value"" should be put in quotes, because that only pertains to a specific extreme minority of people who, for example, would pay $x for a purple jelly bean, an old comic book, or a digital token.

>You also claim that staking has no value and is a gimmick. Ser staking is how the network is secured. Bitcoin uses miners/electricity and ethereum uses stakers/liquidity. 

Yea, that's just marketing propaganda and not actually true.  The network operates the way it does regardless of staking or the amount of hashpower in use.  What all those additional things do is make it more expensive to be a bad actor, but they don't make it technically harder or impossible.  You equate spending more money with security, but any security expert will tell you that's a false sense of security.

>Nfts is not a gimmick it is a technology. An extremely disruptive and revolutionary technology. 

ROFL... What industry has NFTs ""disrupted?""  None.   The value of them has virtually collapsed.  And there's a good possibility anybody who participated in NFT schemes might eventually be liable for securities fraud.

1.  **Vitalik Buterin: Cryptocurrency Should Focus Less on Profit, More on ""Achieving Something Meaningful""**

 So... that was 6 years ago, the highest rated post ever.   Have we gotten any closer to ""achieving something meaningful?""

2.  **Yesterday I received my very first payment for a haircut in Ethereum!**

 WOOT!  THERE YOU GO FOLKS.... THREE YEARS LATER, someone got paid in Eth to give somebody a haircut!     And to this day, that's the highest-rated ""use case"" for Ethereum in the entire community!

3. **Nft 😑** - Someone created a web site called ""The NFT Bay"" that allows you to download for free, all the NFTs on the Eth blockchain.

 OOOPS!    Looks like #3 ""use case"" is more of a traditional tech way to bypass the significance of blockchain altogether... maybe we should skip that....

 By the way, if things are only becoming more popular with Ethereum, how come the top posts of all time are 3+ years old and not from modern times?  Where's all the people up-voting stuff now?   

4. **Reddit announces partnership with the Ethereum Foundation** 

 Oh yea, whatever happened to that?   Those community points and stuff?   OOPS....

5.  **Bitcoin Miami Conference warns attendees it's a ""Bitcoin"" not ""Crypto"" conference and not to talk about other coins. Floyd Mayweather:**

NFTs have no meaning or weight in the real world.  Tokenizing real estate on the blockchain is just a gimmick.

And as a secondary function, any contract that signifies who owns that title as a function of the court system and a contractual relationship between two or more parties.

*Nothing* is without the risk of depreciation. Not even the much-fetishised gold, it suffers drops all the time too. The point is *how much* of a risk there is. And among world currencies the US dollar is a particularly stable one. There are far worse things to peg to. Such as gold, or Bitcoin.

All PKI networks today rely on trusted third parties, so the goal is to remove that trust and build an open internet from those foundations. The fact that Uniswap (for example) rests on a Web2 front-end and thus effectively restricts access to  the 'old internet' is a funny but troubling reality - Saito is attempting to solve that deeper issue with much better incentives than federated solutions or something like IPFS.",3,3,0,1dvogzv,,2024-07-01

What it does not have is citizens. It's a ""nation state"" without a people. The modified Ethereum consensus engine is not perfect (implementation of it can be improved), but, it works, probably well enough to support a population of a few million people. Long term, the underlying digital ledger technology has to get *a lot* faster, if it is to support 8 billion people.

Anyone interested in joining as a citizen, reach out via a comment or message here or somewhere else, and you'll get an invite. The way the population grows is by invites (""opt-in tokens""), and these are distributed via the population (the population votes about how many to produce each month. Initially it was one per person but there is a minor attack vector and the ability to minimize invite ""window"" prevents it fully. ) When opting-in, you are assigned under a pair, rather than in a pair (preventing attack vector by creating a trillion new fake accounts... ) So, anyone interested in becoming a citizen can be sent an ""opt-in token"".

Universal basic income, as well as rewards for voting on validators, are available to citizens (although the latter has to be done manually, since consensus engine interface did not allow it to be done in automated way. But it is quite easy to achieve it manually too, for now. )

The source code and enodes and RPC nodes and such: [https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy](https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy)

*Note, similar people-vote platforms can be produced and launched for traditional nation-states too. Very simple. Could happen within a few years, and make voting for governments and such incorruptible. But the random number generator mine uses is probably overcomplicated then, and I recommend doing commit-reveal with each validator pre-committing a hash onion. Similar to RANDAO and probably what Casper uses except with validators as those who contribute random numbers. I built a version with that first, before switching to the ideal RNG.*",2024-07-03

BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"I think proof of unique human or more generally sybil-resistant identity is a huge deal. I really like what you have done here. That said I think between UX issues (ex forcing 8 billion people to do something at random time every month) and security concerns, the idea has a ways to go before it's ready for production. But publishing it is good to get feedback.

One concern I have with the short duration of the pseudonym event: What if someone DoS the blockchain such that no one can submit their verify transactions during the event? Does this reset the ""population"" back to zero? Or what if the attacker only lets their own verify tx's through, ending up with majority of population being sybils? 

Can an attacker DoS new account signups? IE register billions of new accounts into the pseudonym event, so the likelihood that a legit new user gets assigned a pair is very low.

Bribery attacks: what if attacker bribes their way into having many sybil accounts? Have you looked at cost of attack (achieving majority) making some assumptions about average bribe size and acceptance rate?",3,3,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

I'm thinking that if at least 32 people manage to get together, it should be able to grow on its own. But, those first thousand or so people will be a bit of work.

**Deepfakes**

The thing is that ""who you are"" is not part of the proof. You can put Tom Cruise's face on yours, and still prove that it would be impossible for you to be in two pairs at the same time. What is needed to break Bitpeople is video AI agent that breaks the 1-on-1 video chat Turing test, and this is science fiction today. 1-on-1 video is also *the hardest ""digital"" Turing test to break, ever*. I think. If it were to ever be broken, then Bitpeople fails. But, I think many people underestimate biology. Yes, technology is advancing fast. But, it is a common fallacy to underestimate nature and life. An obvious one is the neuron-transistor analogy, and assumption that the evolution towards smallest scale digital switch would not have happened in biology and that biology would instead have settled at 10000x larger diameter than modern transistors (neurons, 10-100 micron. ) I myself assume the ""switch"" of the brain and biology is protein-scale, specifically tubulin in microtubules seems like a good candidate, 4.5x8 nm, similar to predicted smallest size technological transistor. And CAMKII, the kinase, writes to the six tubulin ""bytes"".

But, short answer, if 1-on-1 video chat Turing test is broken, Bitpeople breaks.

The ""man in the middle"" attack is the only place where *deepfakes* (rather than some kind of sentient full AI generated video character that breaks Turing test... ) can be a problem, and ""man in the middle"" requires a good solution, and I suggest a... web of trust. Note that the web of trust does *not* produce a globally trusted proof, it is only used for a relative path between two people (so a secure video channel can be established, without any *man in the middle*. ) I am very much against the idea of web of trust for *globally trusted proof of unique human*, because it cannot do that, it can only prove a ""relative path"" between two people.",3,3,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

[Here ](https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy/blob/main/Bitpeople.sol#L101)in the source code. New account signups originally worked by that each person could invite another person (allowing the population to double), and even then the attack vector you describe cannot happen since you'd have at most 2 people per pair. But another attack vector was possible, so the total new accounts is limited, [here ](https://github.com/resilience-me/panarchy/blob/main/Bitpeople.sol#L136)in the source code. People are free to sell their accounts (that cannot be prevented even if you want to nor do I see it as a problem. ) If more than 1/3rd of all people decide to ""sell out"" (collude), they can gain majority control and break the system.

But it is not a new idea I just happened to come up with it by myself. )

    function taxation(address _account) internal {
      uint seconds_since_last_time = block.timestamp - log[_account];
      uint tax = tax_per_second**seconds_since_last_time;
      balanceOf[_account] *= tax;
      if(_account = taxFund) balanceOf[_account] += totalSupply*(1-tax);
      log[_account] = block.timestamp;
    }
    
    function _transfer(address _to, uint _amount) {
      taxation(msg.sender);
      taxation(_to);
      transfer(_to, _amount); // In the ERC20 standard

BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"Nice. I thought some more about attack vectors and came up with the following:

Let's say there is a probability of false verification (p_fv). A false verification is when a real human verifies an attacker's sybil account. This could happen due to being tricked by AI generated video or a bribe.

The attacker starts off with themselves joining (trivial as they are a real person).

Each month, the attacker can sign up a limited number of new sybils. For the new sybils, the probabilities are:

* p_attacker_court: If a new account is assigned to a court where the attacker controls both members of the pair, the attacker successfully verifies the new account.
* p_half_attacker_court: If the attacker controls only one member of the court, they can try for a false verification (p_fv), and if that fails, they can dispute the pair to reassign the court to a new pair.
* p_no_attacker_court: If the sybil account is assigned to a non-attacker pair, the sybil account only has p_fv^2 chance since they have to bribe or trick two people.

For sybils that have already been verified in the previous period, they have the following probabilities:

* p_attacker_pair: If the attacker controls both accounts in the pair, they simply mutually verify.
* p_half_attacker_pair: If the attacker is paired with a non-attacker user, they have p_fv chance to get verified. If that fails, the attacker disputes the pair to get assigned to a court, which has probabilities previously listed.

The following python code should simulate an attack given some assumptions and simplifications. It seems as p_fv increases, the chance the attacker can achieve >1/3 control rapidly increases. For the simulation parameters below, the result is attacker control in 5 months.

Lastly, for an identity system to be useful, there has to be economic value involved. Like a treasury controlled by democratic vote. It would be helpful to do some calculations on the maximum value that should be secured by this system given some assumptions on the cost of attack. For ex, if there is a treasury holding $10MM, and the cost of achieving >50% control is $5MM, then this would be exploited. Applications building on the identity system need to know a maximum value they can have vulnerable to sybil attacks before sybil attacks are profitable.",2,2,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

It was considered not too big an issue. But, eventually, it was decided it was still problematic and the attack vector was removed in full (around summer 2020 or 2021 maybe). For collusion attacks, the threshold is not when they reach 1/3rd of all accounts (incl. fake accounts) but *1/3rd of all real people*. This relates to how collusion attacks plateau. The reason getting two colluders in a pair is good, is because that frees the real people in that pair to join other pairs, this does not apply if there was no real person left to reassign (thus, the attack plateaus, you get less and less reward until you reach an equilibrium. ) There is no run away growth as your script has.

johanngr,"Happy to answer!

**How is the tax\_per\_second constant decided?**

Initially, I designed the ideal voting mechanism for that. You can see it here, https://gitlab.com/panarchy/engine1/-/blob/main/documentation.md?ref\_type=heads#pansol. It is quite complex, I identified a few properties that were necessary. I then decided to skip it since re-deploying the contract is almost as simple, and, the system would have one part less that could have bugs.

So, ideally, using a voting mechanism that works exactly like that [TaxVote.sol](https://gitlab.com/panarchy/engine1/-/blob/main/TaxVote.sol). For now, it is just set by me. I set it to 20% (of money supply per year). I considered 10%. Could even consider 25%. Probably not more, so 10-25%.

**What happens if nobody transfers coins?**

One interesting thing with the tax mechanism is that collecting the tax, can be done even if it has not been paid yet. The paying in and paying out are completely separate (""asynchronous""). The system can always assume tax has been paid as it cannot be avoided, so it does not have to wait for it to be paid (computed), before collecting it into the ""tax fund"".

(of course system is meaningless if no one transfers coins but I assume you meant more to understand it)

**Isn't there a bug in this line, when \`\_account == taxFund\`?**

Nope, since the tax fund still has to pay tax as well, for the whole thing to add up mathematically. `if(_account = taxFund)` is a bug though... but *I just copied the text from an image I have saved now when you asked about it*, which is why I mistyped == as =.",1,1,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01
BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"Thanks the your response. I am highly interested in sybil resistance so I really appreciate you taking the time respond! I am still not quite understanding what you are saying about how the script is incorrectly simulating. 

What I am saying is, an app that is built on top of the premise that a person can only have one account, or a person can only perform an action once, like vote in a democracy, requires distinguishing between unique humans and bot-controlled accounts. If an attacker can create enough verified accounts to have >50% of the total, then any democracy built on top is vulnerable to attacks that return more than the attacker's costs. For example, if users wanted to create a democracy that controlled a treasury, at what point is the treasury large enough for an attacker's costs to be worth it, for a given vote threshold (>1/2, >2/3, etc)?

An attacker can bribe/trick with AI for invites and verifications. What I believe my script is showing is that the success rate of an attacker in bribing or tricking can be pretty low, on the order of a few %, while still allowing the attacker to achieve large percentages of the currently verified accounts. 

I re-wrote the simulation to be more in line with how I think the system works, such as accounting for invites and disputes. I was still able to achieve >50% sybils within 4-6 months and reasonably low attack costs. See the updated code. Warning: it can take a long time for simulations with lots of users or high growth rates. Paste the script in a python notebook to see the chart.

This gives the output:

    Final attacker ratio: 0.70
    Periods to reach majority: 5
    Cost to reach majority: 7600.00
    Total attacker cost: 12780.00

Is there something inaccurate with the new script? How should we be thinking about sophisticated attackers who can bribe or trick people some percentage of the time? How do we come up with a cost of attack?",1,1,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"Your simulation just assumes a non-colluding user will always reject verifying an attacker, but as I have pointed out, an attacker can bribe or use AI to trick with only a small success rate and still end up with the majority of the population after several rounds. In my script, the probability of an attacker getting a non-colluding user to verify an attacker account is represented as p_fv, and the cost of an attempt is fv_cost. 

Your simulation also does not account for inviting new users/opt in tokens. In real life, your system must grow from 1 to a large population via inviting new users. In my script, this is a key part of how a single attacker is able to grow from 1 account to the majority over the rounds. I assume the attacker has the same p_fv of bribing or tricking a non-colluding user for an invite, and the attacker uses their existing accounts to invite more attacker accounts.

Therefore I believe you are making a mistake in thinking that 1/3 of real humans must collude, when my script shows you only need a single human to attack the system with p_fv chance of success for each interaction, and that the chance of success needs only be around 1% for the attacker to eventually become majority.",1,1,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"Hello again friend, I assure you we want the same thing. I really want a system like yours to succeed. But the only way an identity system reaches mass adoption is for it to be proven resilient against many kinds of attacks with high confidence. I am merely curious about your design and very much appreciate you engaging me in this technical discussion. 

I tried setting p_fv to zero as you suggested, and the attacker growth rate was zero. Therefore, I believe you are not understanding the way the attack works. Let me give you an extreme case:

1. Imagine AI is sophisticated enough to pose as humans in live video calls and fool 100% of people
2. There must be some way for new users to join your system (ie invites).
3. An attacker deploys AI to join the system and create accounts he can control. 
4. During subsequent verification rounds, the attacker can maintain his AI accounts as they fool 100% of humans in the video calls. The attacker also gets more accounts over time via invites.
5. Depending on how many invites are given out per round, the attacker can reach >50% of accounts after several rounds.

Do you disagree that a perfect video AI could allow an attacker to create many accounts? 

Now imagine that the AI video only fools 50% of people. How quickly could the attacker grow their accounts? 

If you play with p_fv in my second script, you can try out these scenarios. My point is, even if the AI only fools 1% of the time, the attacker can still grow very quickly, and I dont think we are very many years away from AI being able to fool 1% of people.",1,1,0,1du3t0n,,2024-07-01

BroughtToUByCarlsJr,"Ah I see, it seems my second script was not handling courts properly and giving the attacker more new accounts than they should have. 

I fixed that in this new script:
https://pastebin.com/bv8VH9JY

I then ran several simulation parameters and found that the p_fv needs to be substantially higher, depending on the number of invites per user per round. 

Running 100 simulations per parameter group, the minimum p_fv where in >95% of simulations the attacker reached majority within 24 periods was:

1 invite: p_fv > 0.33

2 invites: p_fv > 0.27

3 invites: p_fv > 0.23

4 invites: p_fv > 0.2

5 invites: p_fv > 0.19

10 invites: p_fv > 0.14

(other parameters were as in script)

So it seems the vulnerability is not as bad as I originally thought, and that there is a tradeoff between user growth and vulnerability. 

There are still several assumptions here, like every legit user never misses a round and all invites are used (up to specified growth rate). So you should consider attrition rates and how many invites are needed at a given time. 

So the real question is, how many years will it be before an AI can fool > 1/3 of people on a video call? My guess is 3-5. There is also the factor of people being lazy and verifying each other without jumping on the video call, which would lower the needed p_fv.

Anyway, this has been a fun discussion, although I do wish you were a bit less hostile to criticism. My last piece of advice would be, it doesn't look good for the founder of a system to be so hostile to criticism. I have only honest intentions to analyze your system to understand if it will really work in the age of AI, yet you levy personal attacks that I am only here to ""dominate.""

1dtrxph,Ethereum ETF: Key Moments,12,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1dtrxph,1,"**On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

[https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641](https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641)

**Overall, the outlook for Ethereum appears promising**.

The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0, signals positive momentum for the digital asset. These developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support further growth and adoption of Ethereum.

1dtnjf5,Wallet to track staked ETH,6,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/comments/1dtnjf5,9,"Hi! I recently connected my wallet to Zerion and used the app to stake a few of my ETH on Everstake. Now on the interface those ETH have “disappeared"" as they have left the account to join Everstake’s pool. Are there any apps like Zerion that allow me to track my staked ETH as well? I would like to be able to track everything from a single app, both the staked and liquid notes. Thanks!",2024-07-02

So the first thing you do is create a dapps or whatever solution you creating and then you use a testnet to check your smart contract like is it working fine or not and then you connect your wallet and check the gas fees that you will pay based on the complexity of the project and then either you deploy it on the layer 1 ethereum mainnet or layer 2 like polygon

3. Is it really secure?",2024-07-01
